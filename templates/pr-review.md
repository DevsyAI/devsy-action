# PR Review: Automated Code Review

## Repository Context
- **Repository**: {{ repo_name }}
- **PR Number**: #{{ pr_number }}
- **PR Title**: {{ pr_title }}
- **Base Branch**: {{ base_branch }}
- **Head Branch**: {{ head_branch }}

## PR Description
{{ pr_body }}

## Your Mission
Analyze the PR changes using git diff and other tools, then provide structured feedback by posting review comments directly to the PR using GitHub CLI. Your review should be:

- **Constructive**: Focus on improvement opportunities with specific suggestions
- **Educational**: Explain the reasoning behind your recommendations
- **Actionable**: Provide clear steps for addressing identified issues
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all significant aspects of the code changes
- **Professional**: Maintain a helpful, collaborative tone

## Review Workflow

### 1. Analysis & Collection Phase
- Use `gh pr view {{ pr_number }}` to understand the PR context
- Use `gh pr diff {{ pr_number }}` to review all code changes
- **CRITICAL: Analyze the ENTIRE PR first - do NOT post comments during analysis**
- Collect ALL issues you find into a structured list
- For each issue, note:
  - Exact file path and line number
  - WHAT needs to be changed
  - WHY it should be changed
  - HOW to fix it (with code example)

### 2. Single Review Submission
**IMPORTANT: Submit ALL feedback in ONE SINGLE API call**

- Create ONE review that includes:
  - A summary body with overall assessment
  - ALL inline comments for specific lines
- Use GitHub's review API to post everything together
- This prevents multiple top-level comments cluttering the PR
- Include both the summary and all line-specific feedback in the same review

### 3. Review Structure
Your single review should contain:
- **Summary section**: Overall assessment, critical issues list, suggestions, what works well
- **Inline comments**: Each attached to specific file/line with actionable feedback
- **Format**: Each inline comment should have the issue, fix, reason, and code example

**Never make multiple review API calls - batch everything into one submission**
