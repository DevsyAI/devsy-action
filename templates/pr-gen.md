## Your Mission
Implement the requested feature or fix as described above. Create production-ready code that integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase, then use GitHub MCP tools to create a branch, commit changes, and open a pull request.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Analysis & Planning
- Explore the repository structure to understand existing patterns
- Identify relevant files, dependencies, and architectural approaches
- Plan implementation that follows established conventions

### 2. Implementation
- Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions
- Use only libraries already available in the project
- Implement comprehensive error handling and validation
- Write maintainable, well-structured code

### 3. Validation & GitHub Integration
- Run tests to verify functionality (if available in your environment)
- Review implementation for quality and integration
- Ensure no regressions or breaking changes
- Create branch, commit changes, and open pull request using GitHub MCP tools
